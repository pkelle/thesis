*** model ***
* forecast real (constant price) GDP
  model with unemployment
* forecast HCIP or use 2%+e as inflation rate
* create vector with scheduled ESM loan repayments loan_repayments[]
* take total initial debt; 
  seperate bonds and loans;
  calculate interest payments accordingly;
  ESM rate for loans;
  for bonds either average or seperate between Tbills and bonds;
  look at last few bulletins and look at split between tbills and bonds;
* current cash holdings? 
* model government budget
  surplusses will be used to lower outstanding bonds
  incorporate loan_repayments[] interest payments for debt, debt rollover (bonds)
* total debt to gdp ratio calculation


*** structure ***
* history why greece required debt relief
  - GFC, nonperforming loans of greek banks
  - but also government deficts
* history of rescue/assistance programmes (EFSF, ESM, IMF)
* how the money was used (greek banks, nonperforming loans, service debt, arrears) 
* outlook 2030 model, can greece sustain debt burden
  - debt to gdp ratio
  - gross financing needs to gdp ratio
  - incorporate/discuss some of the debt sustainability analysis from IMF/ECB reports/guidlines
  - compare with long term DSA models from IMF and EU
* look at government income sources and expenses
  - surplus sustainable?
  - amount of one time income from privatisations?
  - look at demographics and impact of government budget
* future outlook greece
  - could debt be paid back?
  - need for more loans? 
  - what is current situation of nonperforming loans of greek banks?
  - influence of inflation
  - influence of interest rate impact for debt rollover
  - why IMF did not participate in the third rescue package, impossible to recover without debt write off? 
* put absolute debt of greence in relation to france or italy and possible future problems for the EU


*** notes ***
(http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2018/624415/IPOL_IDA(2018)624415_EN.pdf)
* Under the ESM programme, primary surplus target is set in terms of primary balance, excluding one-off costs 
  of bank recapitalisations, Securities Markets Programme and Agreement on Net Financial Assets revenues as 
  well as part of the privatisation proceeds. 
* In February 2018, the unemployment rate among women came in at 26.2% as compared with 16.4% for men. 
  The youth unemployment rate stood at 45.4% (it peaked at a staggering 60.5% in February 2013). 
* Note  that Greece returned to bond markets in July 2017 for the first time since 2014, raising EUR 3 
  billion in 5-year bonds at 4.625 per cent. The issue was oversubscribed as market bids amounted 
  to EUR 6.5 billion. As to 2018, Greece successfully tapped markets in February, raising EUR 3 billion in 
  7-year bonds at 3.5 per cent. The issue was again oversubscribed by a factor of around 2.
* Greece  will  furthermore  be  able  to  retrieve  the  interest  accumulated  by  the  Euro-system 
  on Greek government bonds, by semi-annual payments until 2022  [how much?]
* Overall, Greece will be leaving the programme with a sizeable cash buffer of 24.1 billion euros covering the 
  sovereign financial needs in the next 24 months. [where and how reported?]
* In practice, it is difficult to establish numerical thresholds for debt sustainability. As to the debt-to-GDP ratio,    
  thresholds  appear  to  vary  across  countries,  depending  on  macroeconomic  fundamentals and  debt  managem
  ent capacities (e.g. Argentina defaulted when its debt was around 60% of GDP, while Japan continues to sustain 
  debt of more than 200% of GDP). The IMF benchmark is set at 85%.

* „Die Eurogruppe hat sich in ihrer Erklärung zu Griechenland vom 24./25. Mai 2016 darauf ver-
  ständigt, die Schuldentragfähigkeit anhand von Eckwerten für den Bruttofinanzbedarf (gross
  fnancing needs, GFN) zu bewerten (mittelfristig unter 15 % des BIP, anschließend unter 20 % des
  BIP). Die Schuldentragfähigkeitsanalysen der EU-Institutionen einschl. ESM und des IWF zu
  Griechenland stellen ebenfalls auf den Bruttofinanzbedarf ab

* As 97.6% of Greek's debt is denominated in Euro and only 2.4% in other currencies I will ignore any possible exchange rate risks. [http://www.pdma.gr/attachments/article/1659/Bulletin%20No_90.pdf]

*** definitions ***
* Gross Financing Needs: sum of budget deficits [overall balance? incl. interest payments?] and funds required to roll 
  over debt that matures in the course of the year
* Stock Flow Adjustment: A positive SFA means that the government debt increases more than the   
  annual deficit (or decreases less than implied by the surplus). On the  contrary, a negative SFA means that  
  the government debt increases less than the annual deficit (or decreases faster than implied by the surplus).


* debt reduction through inflation will be hard (low inflation expectations)
"Dealing with High Debt in an Era of Low Growth" argues according to their samples that inflation did not help in reducing debt

* interest payments will rise when rolling over debt from troika loans to bonds
* debt ratio reduction through growth also difficult (low future IMF growth estimates)

* why 2030? IMF DSA 5 year normal forecast. longer duration increases inaccuracy. loan repayments start then

-- deltaB =  P + (r-g)B
   B = debt/GDP  P = PrimaryDeficit/GDP, r= real interest , g=real GDP growth

-- "Troika"

(IPOL_IDA document)
-- compare debt structure before and after 3 programmes
-- differences in DSA IMF EU, primary surplus predictions
-- different expectations of privatisation income
-- loans not cash transfered to greece. just payments made for greece
