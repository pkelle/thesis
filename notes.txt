*** model ***
* forecast real (constant price) GDP
  model with unemployment
* forecast HCIP or use 2%+e as inflation rate
* create vector with scheduled ESM loan repayments loan_repayments[]
* take total initial debt; 
  seperate bonds and loans;
  calculate interest payments accordingly;
  ESM rate for loans;
  for bonds either average or seperate between Tbills and bonds;
  look at last few bulletins and look at split between tbills and bonds;
* current cash holdings? 
* model government budget
  surplusses will be used to lower outstanding bonds
  incorporate loan_repayments[] interest payments for debt, debt rollover (bonds)
* total debt to gdp ratio calculation


*** structure ***
* history why greece required debt relief
  - GFC, nonperforming loans of greek banks
  - but also government deficts
* history of rescue/assistance programmes (EFSF, ESM, IMF)
* how the money was used (greek banks, nonperforming loans), what is current situation of nonperforming loans?
* outlook 2030 model, can greece sustain debt burden, debt to gdp ratio
* look at government income sources and expenses
  - surplus sustainable?
  - amount of one time income from privatisations?
  - look at demographics and impact of government budget
* future outlook greece
  - could debt be paid back?
  - influence of inflation
  - influence of interest rate impact for debt rollover
  - why IMF did not participate in the third rescue package, impossible to recover without debt write off? 
* put absolute debt of greence in relation to france or italy and possible future problems for the EU

(http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2018/624415/IPOL_IDA(2018)624415_EN.pdf)
* Under the ESM programme, primary surplus target is set in terms of primary balance, excluding one-off costs 
  of bank recapitalisations, Securities Markets Programme and Agreement on Net Financial Assets revenues as 
  well as part of the privatisation proceeds. 
* In February 2018, the unemployment rate among women came in at 26.2% as compared with 16.4% for men. 
  The youth unemployment rate stood at 45.4% (it peaked at a staggering 60.5% in February 2013). 
* Note  that Greece returned to bond markets in July 2017 for the first time since 2014, raising EUR 3 
  billion in 5-year bonds at 4.625 per cent. The issue was oversubscribed as market bids amounted 
  to EUR 6.5 billion. As to 2018, Greece successfully tapped markets in February, raising EUR 3 billion in 
  7-year bonds at 3.5 per cent. The issue was again oversubscribed by a factor of around 2.
* Greece  will  furthermore  be  able  to  retrieve  the  interest  accumulated  by  the  Euro-system 
  on Greek government bonds, by semi-annual payments until 2022  [how much?]
* Overall, Greece will be leaving the programme with a sizeable cash buffer of 24.1 billion euros covering the 
  sovereign financial needs in the next 24 months. [where and how reported?]
* In practice, it is difficult to establish numerical thresholds for debt sustainability. As to the debt-to-GDP ratio,    
  thresholds  appear  to  vary  across  countries,  depending  on  macroeconomic  fundamentals and  debt  managem
  ent capacities (e.g. Argentina defaulted when its debt was around 60% of GDP, while Japan continues to sustain 
  debt of more than 200% of GDP). The IMF benchmark is set at 85%.
